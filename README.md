# MERN Stack Course Notes and Sample Programs

## Overview
This repository contains my personal notes, code samples, and exercises from the **MERN Stack course**. The course focuses on building full-stack web applications using the **MERN** stack, which consists of **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**. 

I have organized this repository into different sections to help me track my progress and refer back to key concepts as I continue learning and building projects.
