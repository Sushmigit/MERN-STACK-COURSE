react js => updation
usually react when it rerenders it start reading from the start so the updated value will again get assigned to old value
Hooks
usestate => rerenders the page and also keep track of the updated values or states
useState returns a variable and a function to access or control the variable 
Lifecycle of Components
Mounting
updating
Unmounting
useEffect or side effect Hook
useEffect(anonymous fn,empty dependencyi.e empty array)
when we enter into or refresh a page, useEffect triggers that anonymous function and it 'll executed
whenever we want to perform something on updation,we can use useeffect. we do not include 2nd parameter empty dependency. if we don't include it the unction gets triggred always
if we want to perform something on updation of a particular value we can just give that value as 2nd parameter
useEffect on Unmounting
we will give return function inside useeffect
